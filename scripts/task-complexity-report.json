      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Game Loop",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into logical subtasks covering environment setup, file structure creation, game loop implementation, and input handling, with clear acceptance criteria for each.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves initial project setup with moderate complexity. While TypeScript and Vite setup is straightforward, implementing the game loop and input handling requires more technical consideration. The task is well-defined with clear steps but warrants division into focused subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Entities and Basic Physics",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the core entities implementation into subtasks that separately address player implementation, ball physics, rendering systems, collision detection, and field/goal setup, with each subtask having clear deliverables and test scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing fundamental game physics and multiple entity classes with their own rendering and behavior. The collision detection and physics implementation add significant complexity, requiring careful planning and incremental implementation."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core Gameplay Mechanics",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the gameplay mechanics that separately address kicking mechanics with physics calculations, goal detection and scoring logic, game state management system, position reset functionality, and match/game win conditions.",
      "reasoning": "This task introduces complex gameplay mechanics including physics interactions between entities, state management, and scoring systems. The kicking mechanics especially require careful implementation of physics calculations and timing, making this a high-complexity task."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Player Animations and Physics",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the advanced animations and physics into subtasks covering animation system architecture, specific animation implementations (walk cycle, jump, kick), headbutt mechanics, player-player collision physics, and enhanced ball physics.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves sophisticated physics interactions and animation systems. The detailed stick figure animations with multiple states and the complex collision physics between multiple entities represent significant technical challenges requiring careful implementation."

      "taskTitle": "Implement UI and Scoreboard",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI implementation into subtasks for the core UI architecture, scoreboard functionality, game messaging system, and special screens (welcome, game over, trophy), with each having clear visual and functional requirements.",
      "reasoning": "While less complex than the physics tasks, this UI implementation still requires careful design and integration with the game state. The various screens and dynamic elements like score flashing and off-screen indicators add moderate complexity."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the power-up system covering the core power-up architecture, spawning mechanism with parachute physics, collision and activation logic, and implementation of the basic power-up effects with their visual indicators.",
      "reasoning": "This task introduces a new system with its own physics (parachute), collision detection, and temporary effect management. The various power-ups have different effects on gameplay, requiring careful integration with existing systems."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the particle and audio systems into subtasks covering particle system architecture, specific particle effect implementations, audio system architecture with loading/playback, and integration of audio with game events.",
      "reasoning": "Creating flexible particle and audio systems requires careful architecture to handle various effects and sounds efficiently. Both systems need to integrate with multiple game events and maintain performance, adding significant complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Power-ups",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the advanced power-ups implementation into subtasks for the Rocket Launcher system, Sword mechanics with line collision, remaining power-ups implementation grouped by complexity, interaction testing between power-ups, and balancing/tuning of effects.",
      "reasoning": "The advanced power-ups introduce complex new mechanics like projectiles, explosions, and line segment collision. Testing interactions between power-ups adds another layer of complexity, as combinations could lead to unexpected behaviors."

      "reasoning": "This task involves creating systems that affect global game properties like gravity and visuals. The dynamic nature of these systems and their interaction with existing physics add complexity, while performance considerations for particle-heavy effects require careful implementation."
